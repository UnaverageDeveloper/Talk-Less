# Source Selection Rules
selection_rules:
  # Require at least this many sources per summary
  min_sources_per_summary: 2
  
  # Require perspective diversity
  require_diverse_leans: true
  
  # Maximum age of articles to include
  max_article_age_hours: 48
  
  # Minimum credibility score (0-100)
  min_credibility_score: 70

# Notes on Source Diversity:
# - We aim for political diversity (left, center, right)
# - We aim for geographic diversity (local, national, international)
# - We aim for media type diversity (print, broadcast, online-native)
# - Diversity does not mean equal weighting of all perspectives
# - Demonstrable falsehoods are not "perspectives" to balance
