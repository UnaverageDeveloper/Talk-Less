# Bias Detection Rules
#
# This file defines patterns used to detect potential bias in articles.
# These are heuristics, not perfect detection - they will have false positives.
#
# All changes to this file must include rationale.

# Emotionally Loaded Words
# Words that may indicate emotional framing rather than neutral reporting
loaded_words:
  # Strong negative connotations
  - word: "slammed"
    category: "emotional_verb"
    rationale: "Overused in headlines to create drama"
    
  - word: "blasted"
    category: "emotional_verb"
    rationale: "Inflammatory verb with little informational content"
    
  - word: "destroyed"
    category: "emotional_verb"
    rationale: "Hyperbolic language in non-literal context"
    
  - word: "annihilated"
    category: "emotional_verb"
    rationale: "Extreme language inappropriate for most news"
  
  # Emotional nouns
  - word: "outrage"
    category: "emotional_noun"
    rationale: "Describes emotion rather than facts"
    
  - word: "firestorm"
    category: "emotional_noun"
    rationale: "Metaphorical exaggeration"
  
  # Loaded adjectives
  - word: "shocking"
    category: "emotional_adjective"
    rationale: "Tells reader how to feel rather than what happened"
    
  - word: "stunning"
    category: "emotional_adjective"
    rationale: "Injects subjective judgment"

# Attribution Patterns
# Patterns that may indicate weak or biased attribution
attribution_issues:
  - pattern: "sources say"
    issue: "anonymous_sources"
    rationale: "Unnamed sources reduce verifiability"
    
  - pattern: "sources familiar with"
    issue: "anonymous_sources"
    rationale: "Vague attribution reduces accountability"
    
  - pattern: "critics say"
    issue: "vague_group"
    rationale: "Who are the critics? How many? What standing?"
    
  - pattern: "experts warn"
    issue: "vague_group"
    rationale: "Which experts? In what field? Consensus or outliers?"
    
  - pattern: "some people believe"
    issue: "vague_attribution"
    rationale: "Meaningless quantification"

# Framing Indicators
# Patterns that may indicate one-sided or biased framing
framing_patterns:
  - pattern: "only quotes from one political party"
    indicator: "one_sided_quotes"
    rationale: "May indicate framing bias"
    
  - pattern: "headline contradicts body"
    indicator: "misleading_headline"
    rationale: "May indicate clickbait or bias in emphasis"
    
  - pattern: "unattributed opinion in news section"
    indicator: "opinion_in_news"
    rationale: "Opinion should be clearly marked"

# Omission Indicators
# Things that might signal bias by omission
omission_flags:
  - indicator: "missing_counterargument"
    description: "Strong claim without presenting opposing view"
    
  - indicator: "missing_context"
    description: "Statistical claim without baseline or comparison"
    
  - indicator: "missing_outcome"
    description: "Report on prediction without checking if it happened"

# Detection Settings
settings:
  # How to weight different indicators
  weights:
    loaded_words: 1.0
    attribution_issues: 1.5
    framing_patterns: 2.0
    omission_flags: 1.5
  
  # Confidence thresholds
  confidence_levels:
    high: 3.0    # Total weighted score
    medium: 1.5
    low: 0.5
  
  # Context windows for pattern matching
  context_window_words: 50

# Important Notes:
# - These rules WILL have false positives
# - Context matters - not all loaded words indicate bias
# - These are starting heuristics, not comprehensive
# - Rules should be refined based on real-world performance
# - No rule-based system can catch all bias
